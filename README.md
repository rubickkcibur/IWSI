This is the official code repo for Paper **Importance Weighting can Help Large Language Models Self-Improve** in AAAI 2025. For the version with full supplementary materials, please refer to `https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09849`

## Self-Generate samples
To let LLM self-generate samples, use the script `generate_sample_parallel.sh`

## Compute DS weights
To compute DS weights, use the script `compute_weights.sh`

## Train
To start training, use the script `baseline.sh`.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model, use the script `evaluation.sh`.

**We would recommend that you refer to the arxiv version for more details.**
